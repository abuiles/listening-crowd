# Listening Crowd

I wanted to "annotate" stuff from the podcasts I normally listen to. Listening Crowd is a proof of concept for podcast annotations.

Things I learn while building this project:
  - Docker + Amazon EC2 Container Service
  - Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) 
  - [Mobiledoc](https://github.com/bustle/mobiledoc-kit)
  - Listening to podcast in a desktop is actually super boring, the ideal interface for this should be voice-over on mobile, hit me if you know something that does that, I still want it.
  
This is how the annotations look like out in the real world https://www.listeningcrowd.com/listener/abuiles
